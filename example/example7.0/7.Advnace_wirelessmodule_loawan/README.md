# **The nRF2401 wireless module is used to receive and transmit signals** **example**

To complete this case, you need to refer to the detailed documentation tutorial, learn to connect to the gateway, and then burn code to send AT instructions. Detailed documentation tutorials can be found at the bottom of the page.

***\*Note: All examples run on ESP32 version 3.0.2.\****

 

### **How to use example**

 

Learn how to set up a gateway.After opening the sample code in the relevant code file with Arduino IDE.set the required configuration parameters and program it onto the development board

***\*Configuration parameter：\****
